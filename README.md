# Deep learning in dentistry and using panoramic radiographs for developing novel methods

## Project Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive approach to dental image segmentation, utilizing modern deep learning techniques and semi-supervised learning. The goal is to accurately segment and count teeth in panoramic X-ray images, enhancing automated dental diagnostics.

## Datasets:

### Tufts Labeled Dental Dataset

A publicly accessible dataset featuring panoramic X-ray images with annotated dental structures.
